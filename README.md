- 👋 Hi, my name is Javier Morales Carreras - Oracle OCP and ACE pro - and the person behind @CafeDatabase. 
- ☕ "Café Database" is a community project for sharing knowledge in Oracle Databases like having coffee with experts. 
- 🎙  So we have a fancy podcast (in Spanish), and a YouTube Channel (also in Spanish). 
- 🫶 There is also a Patreon page for special content (tutorials, mentorship, workshop labs, etc.).
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a public repository of DBA and developement scripts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and teaching all about Oracle databases administration and SQL - PL/SQL programming, focused on SQL performance tuning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on co-working online, so maybe we may help me building a great repository of database code! 
- 📫 You can reach me at javier@cafedatabase.com or in the Cafe Database Discord server.
