- 👋 Hi, I’m @CafeDatabase. In Café Database we share our knowledge in Oracle Databases having coffee with experts. 
- 🎙  We have a fancy podcast (in Spanish), and a YouTube Channel (also in Spanish). There is also a Patreon page for special content (tutorials, mentorship, etc.)
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a public repository of DBA and developement scripts
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Oracle databases administration and programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on co-working online, so we may build a great repository of database code
- 📫 You can reach me at javier@cafedatabase.com or in the Cafe Database Discord server.
